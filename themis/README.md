# Brave THEMIS

An implementation of Brave's THEMIS research project. This project contains
two privacy-oriented smart contracts, the Policy Smart Contract (PSC) and
the Fund Smart Contract (FSC). Together, the two contracts allow users to
be compensated for engaging with ad publishers. The users do not expose
their identities or preferences.
