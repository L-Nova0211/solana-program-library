title: Stake-Pool Program
---

A program for pooling together SOL to be staked by an off-chain agent running SoM (Stake-o-Matic).

Each SoM needs at least one pool.  Users deposit stakes into the SoM pool
and receives a pool token minus the fee.  The SoM redistributes the stakes
across the network and tries to maximize censorship resistance and rewards.

The project is under construction.
